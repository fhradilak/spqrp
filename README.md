# SPQRP 
For a no-code local-web tool (drag an drop your data) go to: [SPQRP_TOOL](https://github.com/fhradilak/spqrp_tool)


*Sample Provenance Quality Resolver in Proteomics* is a tool that provides quality assessment for plasma-MS-proteome studies. Recent advancements in MS technology and lab methods opened the door for large-scale proteomics but also led to a growing concern regarding sample mix-ups. We built this package to help scientists evaluate whether their sample data is safe for further analysis.
The package now offers functions that can also be used in R code.
Clustering-based approach & visualization:
- `run_clustering` calls:
  - `cluster_samples_iteratively`: creates a graph in a dimensionality reduced space (e.g. with UMAP) based on the distances from perform_distance_evaluation_on_ranked_proteins and can cluster iteratively based on the n nearest neighbours per sample.
  -  `plot_distances_neighbours_with_coloring_hue`: visualizes the graph from cluster_samples_iteratively based on the original data labeling.

Distance Calculation & Threshold-based approach:
- ```result <- spqrp$perform_distance_evaluation_on_ranked_proteins(df = df)``` can be used to apply a distance metric on your data set and retrieve performance metrics based on a threshold.
- ```results <- spqrp$optimize_parameters(df = df)``` can be used to find the optimized parameters for perform_distance_evaluation_on_ranked_proteins for a range of n  proteins used.

# Example Files & Instruction
To get an overview how to use our code in python or R take a look at example_mock_data.py or example_mock_data.rmd

For Python usage: 
1. [Download/ clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/de/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. Open a terminal where the repository is saved on your computer and [create a new environment from requirements.txt](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).
   - (Windows: create a new environemnt: ```py -m venv .venv```, activate it ```.venv\Scripts\activate```, ```cd spqrp```, install requirements: ```py -m pip install -r requirements.txt```)
3. When you want to use jupyter notebook, depending on your IDE you will have to set this .venv as your jupyter kernel:
   - pip install jupyter
   - python -m ipykernel install --user --name=.venv --display-name "SPQRP (venv)"
   - most of the time in the upper right corne of a .ipynb file: select SPQRP (venv) / .venv as your kernel
   - example: <img width="202" height="79" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e2eae05-37c1-4fdd-9e46-a87b1773364d" />

For R:
Follow the instructions in the .rmd file:
  ```{r}
  library(reticulate)
  use_python("path/to/python/environment", required = TRUE)
  virtualenv_create("env")
  use_virtualenv("env",required=TRUE)
  py_install("git+https://github.com/fhradilak/spqrp.git",envname="env",method="virtualenv", upgrade=True, pip = True)
  spqrp <- import("spqrp")
  
  ```

For both:
1. Check that the data requirments are met.
2. Load your data:
   - protein intensity data
   - (optional) your own precomputed protein ranking for the dataset
4. (optional) preprocess you data on your own or with our preprocessing code (shown in both example files at the bottom)
5. (optional) compute a new protein ranking based on your data with our classifier - IMPORTANT - only use raw data (except if your own preprocessing is not impacting data leakage)
6. Clustering: Run Clustering with the selected ranking.
7. (additional): Run the threshol-based method.


# Requirements to use SPQRP in R/ RStudio
## 1. Python Installation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** We recommend installing Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
> Issues have been observed when using the **Microsoft Store version**, particularly with the `reticulate` package in R.  
> You may want to **uninstall the Windows Store version** before proceeding with the official installation.

- ‚úÖ **Best source**: Install from the official Python website:  

- ‚úÖ **During installation**, **tick the "Add Python to PATH" box**:  

- üîç **Find the path to your Python installation:**
  - Open a command line tool (e.g., search for `cmd` in the Windows search bar).
  - On Windows, type:

    ```
    where python
    ```

  - Use the **path before `python.exe`** for integration into R (e.g., when setting `use_python` or `RETICULATE_PYTHON`).


# How to run the Package in Rstudio
### Use This to run the first time
HINT: Try to Restart R if you encounter any issues.
```{r}
Sys.unsetenv("VIRTUAL_ENV") 
Sys.unsetenv("RETICULATE_PYTHON") # optional, ensure nothing forces a different python 

#unlink("C:/Users/FRH/AppData/Local/R/cache/R/reticulate", recursive = TRUE, force = TRUE)
library(reticulate)
virtualenv_remove("env", confirm = FALSE) 
py312 <- "C:/Users/FRH/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/python.exe" 

virtualenv_create("env", python = py312)
use_virtualenv("env", required = TRUE)
py_install("git+https://github.com/fhradilak/spqrp.git", envname = "env", method = "virtualenv", pip = TRUE, upgrade = TRUE)
spqrp <- import("spqrp")
```

### After the first use this block should suffice instead:
```{r}
library(reticulate)
py312 <- "C:/Users/FRH/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/python.exe" 
use_virtualenv("env", required = TRUE)
py_install("git+https://github.com/fhradilak/spqrp.git", envname = "env", method = "virtualenv", pip = TRUE, upgrade = TRUE)
spqrp <- import("spqrp")
```

## 2. Clustering

### üìå Function Purpose
`run_clustering()` clusters the samples based on the precalculated distances for all sample pairings. `n_neighbours` is based on the knowledge about the datasets expected sample size. `max_component_size` is a parameter to adjust the maximum final cluster size, usally set to n_neighbours+1. The function `plot_distances_neighbours_with_coloring_hue()` visualizes sample-to-sample relationships from the clustering using either PCA or MDS dimensionality reduction. It highlights patient-specific groupings and nearest neighbors using color-coded nodes and styled edges in a plot.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters

- **`df`** *(mandatory)*  
  Input dataframe containing **protein intensity values**.
- **`ranking`** *(mandatory)*  
  Protein ranking.
- **`n_neighbors`** *(mandatory)*  
  Number of samples that should have an edge drawn for each sample. The n connected samples are n the nearest neighbours.
- **`max_component_size`** *(mandatory)*  
  Maximum size of clusters: The respective longest edges are iteratively removed for all connected components until only components/ clusters with maximum max_component_size remain.
- **`metric`** *(default: manhattan)*
- **`n`** *(default: 20)*
  number of proteins used for the distance calculation
- **`fractional_p`** *(default: 0.98)*
  p value for fractional distance metric
- **`plot_name`** *(default: "DF_Ranking_X on DF_Y")*

### üß™ Example: Basic Usage in R

```r
df = read.csv("./example_input_cohort_df.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# Create Sample_ID by pasting Px and Time together with an underscore
#df$Patient_ID <- paste(df$Px, df$Time, sep = "_")

top_importance_path ="./example_protein_ranking.csv"

# precomputed ranking on real world data (recommended to test with):
#ranking_cohort_a = pd.read_csv("./spqrp/spqrp/data/ranked_classification_importance_cohort_a.csv")
# ranking = ranking_cohort_a

ranking = read.csv(top_importance_path, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
n_neighbors = 1

spqrp$run_clustering(
    df=df, ranking=ranking, n_neighbors=1, max_component_size=2, plot_name = "Mock ranking on Mock data"

# Additional Information

#### Note on UMAP with small sample sizes
UMAP relies on constructing a k-nearest-neighbor graph to learn the sample manifold. If the number of available samples is small (especially when fewer than ~10‚Äì20), this graph becomes unstable or degenerate. In such cases, UMAP may fail, produce warnings, or yield embeddings that are not meaningful. For very small datasets, alternative methods such as PCA or MDS are typically more robust.



# Extra Details about Clustering

## Clustering Approach and Visualizing Results ‚Äî `cluster_samples_iteratively` & `plot_distances_neighbours_with_coloring_hue`

`cluster_samples_iteratively` clusters the samples based on the precalculated distances from the result from `result <- spqrp$perform_distance_evaluation_on_ranked_proteins()`. `n_neighbours` is based on the knowledge about the datasets expected sample size. `max_component_size` is a parameter to adjust the maximum final cluster size, usally set to n_neighbours+1.

  Parameter that "controls how UMAP balances local versus global structure in the data".([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameters.html))
